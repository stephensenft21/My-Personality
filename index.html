            <h3>"Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which
                is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown
                out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They
                somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary." -Steve Jobs</h3>
            <p>Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and
                confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However,
                Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive,
                determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best
                that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and
                sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to
                thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.</p>

                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <h4>My favorite Commander is Harrison Ford</h4>
                    <p>The underlying thought running through the Commander mind might be something like "I don’t care
                        if you call me an insensitive b*****d, as long as I remain an efficient b*****d".</p>
                    <p>If there’s anyone Commanders respect, it’s someone who is able to stand up to them
                        intellectually, who is able to act with a precision and quality equal to their own. Commander
                        personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of others, and this helps in
                        both their team-building efforts (since no one, no matter how brilliant, can do everything
                        alone), and to keep Commanders from displaying too much arrogance and condescension. However,
                        they also have a particular skill in calling out others’ failures with a chilling degree of
                        insensitivity, and this is where Commanders really start to run into trouble.</p>
                    <p>Commanders are true powerhouses, and they cultivate an image of being larger than life – and
                        often enough they are. They need to remember though, that their stature comes not just from
                        their own actions, but from the actions of the team that props them up, and that it’s important
                        to recognize the contributions, talents and needs, especially from an emotional perspective, of
                        their support network. Even if they have to adopt a "fake it ‘til you make it" mentality, if
                        Commanders are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths,
                        they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories
                        they can handle.</p>

                    <h1> Strengths & Weaknesses</h1>
                    <h3>Strengths:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Efficient -</li>
                        <p>Commanders see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that
                            pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of
                            irrationality and laziness. People with the Commander personality type will root out such
                            behavior wherever they go.</p>
                        <li>Energetic -</li>
                        <p>Rather than finding this process taxing Commanders are energized by it, genuinely enjoying
                            leading their teams forward as they implement their plans and goals.</p>
                        <li>Self-Confident -</li>
                        <p>Commanders couldn’t do this if they were plagued by self-doubt – they trust their abilities,
                            make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders.</p>
                        <li>Strong-Willed -</li>
                        <p>Nor do they give up when the going gets tough – Commander personalities strive to achieve
                            their goals, but really nothing is quite as satisfying to them as rising to the challenge
                            of each obstacle in their run to the finish line.
                        </p>
                        <li>Strategic Thinkers -</li>
                        <p>Commanders exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and
                            navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining every
                            angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project
                            forward with their solutions.</p>
                        <p> These qualities combine to create individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate
                            others, who people actually want to be their leaders, and this in turn helps Commanders to
                            accomplish their often ambitious goals that could never be finished alone.</p>
                        <li>Charismatic and Inspiring -</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stubborn and Dominant –</li>
                        <p>Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far, and Commanders are all too
                            capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate and pushing their
                            vision, and theirs alone.</p>
                        <li>Intolerant –</li>
                        <p>“It’s my way or the highway” – People with the Commander personality type are notoriously
                            unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, and even more so of ideas
                            based on emotional considerations. Commanders won’t hesitate a second to make that fact
                            clear to those around them.</p>
                        <li>Impatient –</li>
                        <p>Some people need more time to think than others, an intolerable delay to quick-thinking
                            Commanders. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste,
                            a terrible mistake for a leader to make.</p>
                        <li>Arrogant –</li>
                        <p> Commander personalities respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities,
                            and look down on those who don’t match up. This relationship is a challenge for most other
                            personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own right, but will seem so beside
                            overbearing Commanders.</p>
                        <li>Poor Handling of Emotions -</li>
                        <p>All this bluster, alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes Commanders distant
                            from their own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others’. People
                            with this personality type often trample others’ feelings, inadvertently hurting their
                            partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.</p>
                        <li>Cold and Ruthless –</li>
                        <p>Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism,
                            especially professionally, makes Commanders incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals,
                            dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and
                            irrelevant.</p>

                    <h2>My Strengths</h2>
                    <p>I know that I am self-confident, energetic/passionate. I am charismatic and love to inspire
                        others by using positive reinforcement.</p>
                    <h2>My Weaknesses</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have a tendancy to be stubborn and dominate in arguments. I love to have my way. i can be
                        impatient at times and do struggle with arrogance.

                    <h1>Friendships</h1>
                    <p>"It’s not easy to stand up to a personality as big and blustery as Commanders’, and they too
                        often find that others crumple under the force they apply when they really start to enjoy
                        themselves."</p>
                    <p>
                        As in most aspects of their lives, in friendship Commanders seek personal growth and
                        inspiration, and they often have a plan for how to accomplish it. Friendships of circumstance,
                        built on things like shared routines, are not Commanders’ preferred method – rather, they
                        pursue their friends, seek out individuals who share their passion for deep, meaningful
                        discussions, and who enjoy learning and development as much as they do. It is not always easy
                        to be Commanders’ friends – they demand a lot from these relationships – but they pay a great
                        deal of attention to their friendships, and it is unlikely that it will ever feel stagnant.
                    </p>
                    <p>Commander friendships are built on ideas, and a lot of what they find enjoyable is the repartee
                        of putting thoughts forward and defending them from assault from every angle. People with the
                        Commander personality type are very smart and highly critical, and they won’t back down if they
                        are put on the defensive – in fact, there’s no better way to earn their respect.</p>

                <h1>Career Paths</h1>
                <p>"For Commanders, failure is not an option – they conceive a vision of the future, formulate a
                    strategy to achieve that vision, and execute each step with ruthless precision."</p>

                <p>Structure and order are key, and if someone gets sloppy, or holds things back with incompetence,
                    laziness or inefficiency, Commanders will not hesitate to come down, hard. Commander personalities
                    pursue their goals with singular vision, and have strict standards for themselves and others that
                    are designed above all else to be effective. This makes Commanders excellent corporate strategists,
                    and their objectivity and clarity of thought make them respected lawyers and judges.</p>

                <h2>What I am looking for in a Career</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>An environment that is positive and keeps me hungry for knowledge</li>
                    <li>To be surrounded by like-minded individuals that work well as a team</li>
                    <li> To never be stagnate in something that i don't enjoy.</li>
                    <li>I want a career that allows me to travel and meet new people along the way.</li>

                <h1> Workplace Habits</h1>
                <p>"Commander personality types are strident ones though, able to adapt themselves to just about any
                    hierarchical relationship by doing what they do best: asserting their opinions, taking the
                    initiative, and accomplishing feats that others thought impossible."</p>

                <p>For people with the Commander personality type, the workplace is all but a natural habitat.
                    Commanders’ efficiency and clear communication are valued, their leadership is admired, and their
                    ability to simply get things done is unrivaled. That being said, some situations are more
                    appropriate for Commanders than others – these qualities all point to a managerial or executive
                    role, making any position of comparative powerlessness highly undesirable.</p>
